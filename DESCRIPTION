Description: Functional enrichment from a list of features (genes, proteins, etc)
    using hypergeometric distribution. Optimised for speed for use in interactive
    applications, e.g., Shiny. Allows to download functional data from GO, KEGG,
    BioPlanet, Reactome and WikiPathways. Once downloaded, data are converted into
    a format allowing for fast enrichment analysis.
